# Description: Set up the Mario game by reading data from the input data file
#              and using this data to initialize variables, then create and
#              display the maze in which Mario is to move.
#
# Please, read Readings 12.1 to 12.5 (inclusively) as well as 
# 11.1 to 11.5 (inclusively). Also, read about Python lists of lists.
